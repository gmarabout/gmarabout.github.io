That is it! Today, I start this new blog using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com)!
Jekyll is a static site generator with blog-aware features. Actually, blog posts are first class citizen with Jekyll.

To start using Jekyll, you must first have a proper running Ruby environment. 
I am using the [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io) to install and manage Ruby on my Macbook Air laptop. 
Then running the Jekyll CLI is as simple as `gem install bundler jekyll` and `jekyll new my-awesome-site`.
